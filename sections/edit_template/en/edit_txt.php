<h3>How to edit text</h3>

<p>As previously stated, all site content is inserted to .html files. You'll need minimal skills on orienting within
    code.</p>

<p> In order to replace “lipsum” (filling text) with your own one please, do the following:</p>

<ol class="index-list">
    <li>Navigate to ‘site_granter’ folder within template package.</li>
    <li>Open index.html file with HTML editor.</li>
    <li>You may use search function <b>(CTRL+F)</b> to check for required text.</li>
    <li>Edit text with HTML editor. Save changes and open your file in browser to see them applied.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, in order to check for required sections, you may use browser developer tools. </p>

<p>Please check articles and tutorials to find out more on how to use developer's tools.</p>
